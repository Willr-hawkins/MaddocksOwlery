    <h4 class="text-center fw-bold subheading">| Our Story |</h4>
    <p class="text-center">
      After running a beloved riding stables in North Devon for over three decades, 
      Simon Maddocks made a bold and heartfelt decision: to dedicate his land, time, and passion to nature recovery. In 2020, the stables closed, and the real work began.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      With 25 acres of personal land, and an additional 10 acres in collaboration with the National Trust, Simon began restoring habitats and encouraging biodiversity. 
      Nest boxes for owls and kestrels were installed. Partnerships were built — including one with the Bumblebee Conservation Trust to support the rare brown-banded Carder bee — and results were soon visible.

    <h4 class="text-center fw-bold subheading">| The Wildlife Tower |</h4>
    <p class="text-center">
      In 2024, the dream of building a permanent, purpose-built wildlife tower became reality.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      Situated near one of the original owl boxes — which saw successful barn owl nesting — the tower is a response to the growing crisis of habitat loss. 
      Old barns once home to owls and bats are falling into disrepair or being converted into second homes. 
      The wildlife tower is Simon’s answer: a structure designed to last a century, created only to serve nature.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      Constructed from locally sourced stone and shaped by local stonemasons, the tower reflects the land it stands on — rugged, rooted, and full of life.

      But this isn’t just about bricks and mortar. The tower includes specially designed spaces for barn owls and bats to roost, 
      with camera systems (funded in part by a grant from CaRA) offering a rare and respectful window into their lives. These live feeds will be available soon to the public.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      A nearby viewing platform is also being built — a non-invasive way for visitors to observe the tower from a distance, without disturbing its wild residents.

      Maddocks Owlery isn't just a sanctuary for birds — it's part of a wider effort to nurture the ecosystem as a whole. On the surrounding meadows, 
      Simon uses Mangalica pigs and Belted Galloway cattle to manage the land in a natural way, promoting plant diversity and supporting pollinators.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      From bees to barn owls, the project fosters life across the food chain.

      The project has always been about more than just one man’s vision. An 80% grant from North Devon National Landscape (formerly AONB), 
      along with crowdfunding and local labor, brought the tower to life. It’s a legacy created with the community — and for the community.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      Simon hopes to use the owlery not just for conservation, but also for education — inviting people to reconnect with the land and the life it supports.
